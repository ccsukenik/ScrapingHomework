# ScrapingHomework

Objective:

The challenge was to scrape Oorah's website to get auction prizes and display them on a page. The data to be included were pictures of each prize, prize names, and their winners.

Solution:

The backend of this application is written in C# using ASP.Net Core with React framework. It uses AngleSharp to interact with page from Oorah's website to select the data needed. The frontend code is written in JavaScript using the React library.

You can view the webpage I scraped here:
